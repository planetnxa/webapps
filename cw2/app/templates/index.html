                    <div style="text-align: left;">
                        Marie, also known as <i>RHI</i>, is a graphic designer. A creative genius if you will. Born
                        and raised in London, she knew she was never destined for the life of a tech-fleece babe.
                        Inspired by the "beauty" around her, she decided to
                        develop her own aesthetic. Marie creates visual experiences, not just for the "girl boss
                        CEOs" you see on Instagram. Her goal is to design and create visuals that inspire others to
                        be their authentic selves.
                        We hope her projects inspire you to create
